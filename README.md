# Google's gtest framework

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a git repo of whatever version of google's gtest framework I use in my development process.  This will allow it to be a submodule, and not have massive git commits in other projects.

This is merely a snapshot of the zip archive; no modifications have been made to the gtest code.

Current version: 1.7.0
